# Simple Site Builder 

## Overview

Simple Site Builder builds websites. 
It's designed for making personal sites that 
use HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, 
Web Components, and JavaScript Libraries
without requiring an underlying framework. 

(It's specifically designed to compliment
[bitty-js](https://bitty-js.alanwsmith.com/))

## Goals

- [x] Single binary that can be run
downloaded and run from the command 
line with no other dependencies.

- [x] Built-in preview server.

- [x] Automatically reload preview pages 
when content changes. 

- [x] Use jinja style templates, but 
with tokens that are easier to read (i.e.
`[! raw !][! !][! endraw !]`, 
`[! raw !][@ @][! endraw !]`, and
`[! raw !][# #][! endraw !]` instead of
`{% %}`, `{{ }}`, and `{# #}`
)

- [x] Control what's published and
what's only used for includes
by naming convention (i.e. things
that start with an "_" don't
get published directly).

- [x] Apply syntax highlighting to 
full files. 

- [x] Apply syntax highlighting to
individual code snippets. 

- [x] Markdown can be used inside files
via a filter. 

- [x] Markdown files can be included
in other files

- [x] Provide file listings (e.g. for 
providing links)

- [x] Provide folder listing (e.g. that
can be used to include all files in
a folder)

- [x] Automatically move .html files that
aren't `index.html` into a folder with 
their filename and put the contents in
a corresponding `FOLDER-NAME/index.html` file
(e.g. `sub-dir/about.html` becomes `sub-dir/about/index.html`).
This helps improve portability if the site
is moved or switched to another builder/framework.

- [x] Run .html files through minijinja when building
the site. 

- [] Automatically load .json files to use as
data across templates. 

- [] Run .md files through minijinja when building
the site. 

- [] Read optional YAML frontmatter form .md files 
to use as data on the page. 

- [] Use a YAML frontmatter "template" variable 
to set the template used for the page. 

- [] Run anything inside the `scripts/pre` folder
prior to building the site. 

- [] Run anything inside the `scripts/post` folder
after building the site.

- [] A GUI front end so the command line
isn't required. 

## Examples

These examples cover the basics.

## Notes

- The github repo is at
[https://github.com/alanwsmith/simple_site_builder](https://github.com/alanwsmith/simple_site_builder)

- This is mainly a personal project. 
That said, it's stable enough to use
if you're a person who likes to tinker
with things.
