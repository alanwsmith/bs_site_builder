  <h1>ssbuild</h1>
  <p>my personal static site builder</p>
</hgroup>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  ssbuild is a <strong>very</strong> opinionated (and hacky) static site
  builder. It's designed to make it quick and easy for me to create new
  mini-sites. It'll be replaced by
  <a href="https://www.neopoligen.com/">Neopoligen</a> once that app is ready.
  It lets me get ideas outta my head with less friction in the mean time.
</p>
<p>
  It also give me another rep in designing and building a static site generator.
</p>
<p>
  I wouldn't recommend trying to use it. It's super customized for the way I'm
  currently working. Feel free to poke around
  <a href="https://github.com/alanwsmith/ssbuild">the source code</a>
  if you're into that kinda thing.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>[x] Runs in the current directory.</li>

  <li>[x] Loads every `.html` file in `content` as a template.</li>
  <li>
    [x] Renders `.html` files (except those in directories that start with a `_`
    at the root of the project) and puts the output in the `docs` directory with
    the same file name/path. The provides a way to drop generic template files
    in a `_templates` directory that can be used in other files without
    publishing them.
  </li>
  <li>[x] Empties the `./docs` output directory before each run.</li>
  <li>[x] Runs a local dev server with hot-reload when files change.</li>
  <li>
    [x] Automatically finds an available port for the server so multiple
    instances can be run at the same time.
  </li>
  <li>
    [x] Automatically make the `content`, `docs`, `data`, and `scripts`
    directories if they don't exist.
  </li>
  <li>
    [x] Automatically creates an `index.html` file when making `content`
    directory if it doesn't exist.
  </li>
  <li>
    [x] Automatically creates a netlify.toml file when making a `content`
    directory if one doesn't already exist.
  </li>
  <li>
    [x] Copies non-html files from `content` directly to `docs` with the same
    file name/path (skipping files in directories at the root that start with a
    `_`)
  </li>
  <li>
    [x] Runs any executable files in the `scripts` directory (sorted by name)
    prior to each build.
  </li>
  <li>[x] Serves a default 404 page if a file isn't found.</li>
  <li>
    [x] Load any `.json` files in the `data` directory into the payload that's
    send to each render
  </li>
  <li>
    [x] If run in a directory without a content folder it asks if you want to
    make a new site.
  </li>
  <li>
    [x] When you make a new script in the scripts directory it asks you if you
    want to make it executable
  </li>
  <li>[] Hoist minijinja errors to output pages</li>
  <li>
    [] Put clap on the script so you can do <code>ssbuild --version</code>

</ul>
