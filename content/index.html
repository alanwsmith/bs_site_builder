# Simple Site Builder 

## Overview

This is <strong>strong text</strong>.

- This is the tool I use for making simple
websites. 

- It's more of a personal project right
now. That said, if you like poking
around with things it's stable
enough to use for personal sites. 

- The builder uses Jinja style templates. 

- Markdown can be used inside files
via a filter. 

- Markdown files can be included
in other files

- file and directory lists are
available as data for filtering
includes, etc...

- The github repo is at
[https://github.com/alanwsmith/simple_site_builder](https://github.com/alanwsmith/simple_site_builder)
