    <h1>ssbuild</h1>
    <p>my personal static site builder</p>
  </hgroup>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    ssbuild is a <strong>very</strong> opinionated (and hacky) static site
    builder. It's designed to make it quick and easy for me to create new
    mini-sites. It'll be replaced by
    <a href="https://www.neopoligen.com/">Neopoligen</a> once that app is ready.
    It lets me get ideas outta my head with less friction in the mean time.
  </p>
  <p>
    It also give me another rep in designing and building a static site
    generator.
  </p>
  <p>
    I wouldn't recommend trying to use it. It's super customized for the way I'm
    currently working. Feel free to poke around
    <a href="https://github.com/alanwsmith/ssbuild">the source code</a>
    if you're into that kinda thing.
  </p>

  <h2>Features</h2>

  <pre>
- [x] Runs in the current directory

- [x] Loads every `.html` file in `./content` 
    as a template.

- [x] Skips `.html` files in directories
    that start with a `_` at the root of
    the project. Everything else gets processed
    and its output placed in `./docs` with
    a matching file name/path.

- [x] Empties the `./docs` output directory 
    before each run.

- [x] Runs a local dev server with hot-reload
    when files change.

- [x] Automatically finds an available port
    for the server so multiple instances
    can be run at the same time.

- [] Automatically make `content` and
    `docs` directories if they don't exist.

- [] Automatically make an `index.html` file
    when making `content` directory if it 
    doesn't exist. 



- [x] Pulls .html files from `./content`,
processes them as templates in MiniJinja
and drops the output in `./docs` with the same
file name/path that the source file had in `./content`.

- [] Copies non .html files from `./content/`
directly to `./docs` with the same file name/path.

- TODO: Serves a dev version of the site out
of a "docs" folder in the current directory.

- TODO: Loads templates from the "templates"
folder in the current directory.

- TODO: Runs any executable files in a 
"scripts" directory" sorted by when things
change (TBD on filtering this so content
doesn't trigger scripts which make content
that trigger scripts etc...)

- TODO: Runs ".html" files in the "content" folder
through minijinja and puts the results
in the "docs" folder with the same filename. 

- TODO: Copies other files from the "content" folder
into the "docs" folder unchanged

- DONE: Looks for a free port to serve on between
5444 and 6000

- TODO: Servers a built-in 404 page if a file can't
be found.
