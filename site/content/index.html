  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    ssbuild is a <strong>very</strong> opinionated (and hacky) static site
    builder. It's designed to make it quick and easy for me to create new
    mini-sites. It'll be replaced by
    <a href="https://www.neopoligen.com/">Neopoligen</a> once that app is ready.
    It lets me get ideas outta my head with less friction in the mean time.
  </p>
  <p>
    I wouldn't recommend trying to use it. It's super customized for the way I'm
    currently working. Feel free to poke around
    <a href="https://github.com/alanwsmith/ssbuild">the source code</a>
    if you're into that kinda thing.
