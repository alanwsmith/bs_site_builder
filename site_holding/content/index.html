    <h1>ssbuild</h1>
    <p>my personal static site builder</p>
  </hgroup>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    ssbuild is a <strong>very</strong> opinionated (and hacky) static site
    builder. It's designed to make it quick and easy for me to create new
    mini-sites. It'll be replaced by
    <a href="https://www.neopoligen.com/">Neopoligen</a> once that app is ready.
    It lets me get ideas outta my head with less friction in the mean time.
  </p>
  <p>
    It also give me another rep in designing and building a static site
    generator.
  </p>
  <p>
    I wouldn't recommend trying to use it. It's super customized for the way I'm
    currently working. Feel free to poke around
    <a href="https://github.com/alanwsmith/ssbuild">the source code</a>
    if you're into that kinda thing.

  <h2>Features</h2>

  <pre>
[x] Runs in the current directory.

[x] Loads every `.html` file in `content` 
    as a template.

[x] Renders `.html` files (except those in
    directories that start with a `_` at the 
    root of the project) and puts the output
    in the `docs` directory with the same 
    file name/path.

    The provides a way to drop generic template
    files in a `_templates` directory that
    can be used in other files without 
    publishing them. 

[x] Empties the `./docs` output directory 
    before each run.

[x] Runs a local dev server with hot-reload
    when files change.

[x] Automatically finds an available port
    for the server so multiple instances
    can be run at the same time.

[]  Automatically make the `content`, `docs`, 
    and `scripts` directories if they don't exist.

[]  Automatically creates an `index.html` file
    when making `content` directory if it 
    doesn't exist. 

[] Automatically creates a netlify.toml file when making
    a `content` directory if one doesn't 
    already exist.

[x] Copies non-html files from `content`
    directly to `docs` with the same file 
    name/path (skipping files in directories 
    at the root that start with a `_`)

[] Runs any executable files in the `scripts` 
    directory (sorted by name) prior to 
    each build.

[] Serves a default 404 page if a file isn't
    found.

[] Load any `.json` files in the `data` directory
    into the payload that's send to each 
    render
