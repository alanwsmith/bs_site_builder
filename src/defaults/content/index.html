This is the default page for a new
_bs_ site. 


## Quickstart

- Edit files in the `content` directory
to update your site. For example, the content for 
this page is in the `content/index.html` file. 

  _bs_ automatically reloads the browser 
  so you can see your changes immediately. 

- You can use Jinja style template functionality 
in `.html` files. The `content/_templates` directory
is set up to house them. For example, the wrapper for the
`content/index.html` page is `content/_templates/wrapper.html`

- Data from any `.json` files in the `content/_data`
directory is available in the templates. 
  For example, the links at the top of the page 
  and the footer are defined in `content/_data/config.json`

- Scripts in the `content/_scripts` directory get run
each time there's a change to the content. For example, 
the `content/_scripts/update-timestamp.bash` file 
updates the `content/_data/updated.json` file with
the current date. It's what gets used to
show the date at the bottom of this page. 


## Templates

_bs_ uses MiniJinja with custom delimiters. Specifically, 
it uses:

- `[! raw !][! !][! endraw !]` instead of `{% %}` for
blocks. 

- `[! raw !][@ @][! endraw !]` instead of `{@ @}` for
variables. 

- `[! raw !][# #][! endraw !]` instead of `{# #}` for
comments. 

I find the square brackets easier to track visually.

Check out [the MiniJinja 
documentation](https://docs.rs/minijinja/latest/minijinja/)
for details. (Just remember to keep the delimiter changes in mind.)


## Markdown

_bs_ supports Common Markdown. To use it, 
wrap markdown text inside a MiniJinja
filter like this:

[! endfilter !]


<pre>
[! raw !][! filter markdown|safe !][! endraw !]

# Markdown Content Goes Here

The quick brown fox jumps over
the lazy dog. etc...

[! raw !][! endfilter !][! endraw !]

## More About bs

_bs_ is mostly a personal project. 
I make [a lot of little websites](https://links.alanwsmith.com/). 
I built _bs_ to reduce reduce the friction it takes to spin
a new one up. 

I wouldn't try to run a big website off it (e.g.
there's no built-in router),
but it's stable enough to tinker
with if you're into that type of thing. 

I'm also working on a full-featured
generator called [Neopoligen](https://www.neopoligen.com).
The secondary purpose of _bs_ is to act
as a playground for it.
