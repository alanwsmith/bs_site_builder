## Welcome to bs!

This is the default page for a new
_bs_ site. 


## Quickstart

- Edit files in the "content" directory
to update your site. 

  The content for this page is in the
  `content/index.html` file. 

- You can use Jinja style template functionality 
in `.html` files. (TKTKTK More details below)

  For example, the wrapper for the `content/index.html`
  page is `content/_templates/wrapper.html`


- Data from any `.json` files in the `content/_data`
directory is available in the templates (TKTKTK More details
below)






## Usage

- Run `bs` from the command line in an 
empty directory. It'll ask you if you want
to build a website in the directory. 
Hitting "y" for yes will create the scaffold
for a new site and launch a local 
web browser showing it. 

(You probably already did this if you're
reading this page)

- The scaffold consists of two directories
named "content" and "docs" and two files
named "netlify.toml" and README.md.

  The "content" directory is where you'll
  make all your changes.  

  The "docs" directory is where `bs` builds 
  the files that get used by browsers to
  show your site. 

  The "netlify.toml" file is there so you can 
  publish your site on netlify easily. 
  You can safely ignore it

  The "README.md" file can be used to add
  information about your site if you use
  something like GitHub. You can safely
  ignore it

  




## About bs

I make [a lot of little websites](https://links.alanwsmith.com/).
This is mostly a personal project to
reduce the friction it takes to spin
up a new one. 

I'm also working on a more full-featured
generator called [Neopoligen](https://www.neopoligen.com).
The secondary purpose of _bs_ is to act
as a playground for it.
